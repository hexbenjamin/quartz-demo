## Background
A few years back, I was part of a musical project called Bump Squad, with my brother and 2 of the homies from high school. I was really, REALLY into 'IF YOU PRAY RIGHT' by [BROCKHAMPTON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) not long before one of our beats got produced and, well... I made the song.
